  /** A class for implicit values that can serve as implicit conversions
   *  The implicit resolution algorithm will act as if there existed
   *  the additional implicit definition:
   *
   *    def $implicitConversion[T, U](x: T)(c: ImplicitConverter[T, U]): U = c(x)
   *
   *  However, the presence of this definition would slow down implicit search since
   *  its outermost type matches any pair of types. Therefore, implicit search
   *  contains a special case in `Implicits#discardForView` which emulates the
   *  conversion in a more efficient way.
   *
   *  Note that this is a SAM class - function literals are automatically converted
   *  to `ImplicitConverter` values.
   *
   *  Also note that in bootstrapped dotty, `Predef.<:<` should inherit from
   *  `ImplicitConverter`. This would cut the number of special cases in
   *  `discardForView` from two to one.
