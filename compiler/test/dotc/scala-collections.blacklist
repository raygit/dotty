## Compiling the scala.reflect package object together with other files sometimes leads to cycles,
## but only when compiling with a non-bootstrapped dotty-library, because unpickling DottyPredef
## requires scala.reflect.ScalaSignature which forces the scala.reflect package object.
## Since we'll eventually be fully bootstrapped, it's not worth fixing by adding workarounds.
