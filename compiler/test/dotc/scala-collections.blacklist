## Errors having to do with unavailable APIs or language features:

scala/text/Document.scala
# Lots of type errors for pattern matches, having to do with the fact
# that Document contains a :: method without corresponding extractor,
# but still wants to extract lists using ::. We won't support that.
# Since Document should have been removed already, let's ignore it.

scala/AnyVal.scala
# 55 |abstract class AnyVal extends Any {
#    |^
#    |illegal redefinition of standard class AnyVal
# (This is intended)

scala/reflect/package.scala
# 63 |  private[scala] def materializeClassTag[T](): ClassTag[T] = macro ???
#    |                                                             ^^^^^

scala/StringContext.scala
# 168 |  def f[A >: Any](args: A*): String = macro ???
#     |                                      ^^^^^
